\section{Organization Of the Report}

\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter 2 explains the simulation environment we built.
\item Chapter 3 contains a description of the algorithms we decided to use.
\item Chapter 4 contains the results of our simulations.
\item Chapter 5 contains a discussion of our results, comparison and conclusions.
\end{itemize}




\section{Background}
The objective of this section is to give a short theoretical
background of optimization. Also a general description of the Pursuit and Evasion problem.
\subsection{What is optimization}
What is optimization?\\
What is an optimal solution?\\
Non-optimal solutions?\\
Good solutions and computational time?\\
\\

\subsection{(the need for) a near optimal solution}
Giving a very short background for the following section. 

\subsection{P \& NP problems}
explain what P and NP-hard problems is, and what consequenses it yields. 

\subsection{Heuristic methods}
Explanation of what heuristic methods is, and how one sacrifices
optimality for gain in computational time.\\
